            Multi-platinum selling singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles is scheduled to release a new live DVD and CD package she executive produced titled Brave Enough: Live at the Variety Playhouse on October 22 through Epic Records.  Filmed live at the Variety Playhouse in Atlanta, Georgia during “The Brave Enough Tour,” which sold out nationally in three minutes, the DVD captures Sara’s entire May 20, 2013 performance.  Celebrated by fans and media alike, the set features show highlight “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” Bareilles’ never-before-released breathtaking version of Elton John’s classic song.

            This release supports Bareilles’ highly acclaimed third studio album, The Blessed Unrest, which debuted at #2 on the Billboard album chart and continues to gain critical praise.  Billboard Magazine recently hailed the album as “Bareilles’ most ambitious album yet,” while USA Today praised: “Bareilles’ third studio album is her most mature and satisfying to date…”

            Bareilles’ critically acclaimed sophomore release Kaleidoscope Heart was released in September of 2010 and debuted at #1 on the Billboard top 200 chart. It gained critical praise everywhere including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, People, and the Los Angeles Times.  The album yielded the hit single “King of Anything,” which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and was certified platinum by the RIAA.

            In 2011, Bareilles joined the judge’s panel on the hit NBC show The Sing-Off.  In early 2012, Bareilles released a documentary called A Trace of the Sun: Volunteering in Japan, which chronicled her trip to Japan where she joined All Hands Volunteer efforts in the city of Ofunato after the 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that devastated coastal cities and left over 26,000 people without homes.  Soon after, she released her critically acclaimed Once Upon Another Time EP, which was produced by singer/songwriter and fellow Sing-Off judge Ben Folds.
